Let $G$ be a finite simple graph.
Show that one can partition the vertices into two groups such that
for each vertex, at least half the neighbors are in the other group.

---

Consider any random partition. Now choose a vertex $v$
which has $x_v,y_v$ neightbors in the same and different group respectively,
with $x_v > y_v$, and send it to the other group, this increases the sum
$\sum_{\nu \in G} (y_\nu)$ by $2(x_v - y_v)$ because
vertices in the same and different groups add and subtract $1$
respectively. This is a monovariant, we are done.
