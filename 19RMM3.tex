Given any positive real number $\epsilon$, prove that,
for all but finitely many positive integers $n$, any graph
on $n$ vertices with at least $(1+\epsilon)n$ edges has 
two distinct simple cycles of equal lengths.

Let the sorted set of distinct cycles be $\{a_1,a_2,...,a_k\}$
Note that clearly $k \geq \epsilon n$.

Assume the graph $G$ doesnt have duplicate cycles yet.

Consider the cycle $a_k$ we will count the number of 
edges insider $a_k$ that force a $a_i$ cycle in this by $f(a_k,a_i)$, note that
