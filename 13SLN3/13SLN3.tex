Let $f(n)=n^2 + n + 1$ and $P(n) = \text{max prime of } n$. 

Note that $f(n^2) = n^4+n^2+1 = f(n)f(n-1), f((n+1)^2) = f(n+1)f(n)$.

We have $$f(n)|\gcd(f(n^2),f((n+1)^2))$$

So we would be done if we prove that
\begin{claim}
	There exist infinitely many $n$ such that $$P(f(n-1)) \leq P(f(n)) \geq P(f(n+1))$$
}
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
	Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are only finitely many $n$ that satisfy this.

	So, $\exists N$ such that $\{P(f(n))\}_{n\geq N}$ is monotonic.

	Now clearly if this were decreasing we would get a contradiction, so, assume $\{P(f(n))\}_{n\geq N}$ is strictly increasing. 

	\newline

	But we already know, $$P(f(n^2)) = \max(P(f(n)),P(f(n-1)))$$ so it cannot be strictly increasing and we are done. 
\end{proof}
