Let $G$ be a graph and let $k$ be a positive integer.
A $k$-\emph{star} is a set of $k$ edges with a common endpoint
and a $k$-\emph{matching} is a set of $k$ edges such that
no two have a common endpoint.
Prove that if $G$ has more than $2(k-1)^2$ edges then
it either has a $k$-star or a $k$-matching.

Assume FTSOC there is neither. Consider the maximal matching of size $m \leq k-1$ 
then all the edges in the graph must be adjacent with 
one of the edges in the matching. Bounding the number of edges
\[E \leq 2m(k-2) + m \leq (k-1)(2k-3) < (k-1)^2 \]
