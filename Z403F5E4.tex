In a right-angled triangle $ABC$, point $D$ lies in the interior of leg $AC$, and point $E$ lies on the extension of hypotenuse $AB$ beyond $B$. The second intersection of circles $ADE$ and $BCE$ (different from $E$) is $F$. Show that $\angle CFD = 90^\circ$

Redefine $F$ to be the intersection of the circle with diameter $CD$ and $(ADE)$. We are left to show that 
$C,F,B,E$ are concyclic which is proved by the following angle chase:
\[ \boxed{\angle FEB} = \angle FEA = \angle FDA = 180^\circ - \angle FDC \]
But notice that $BC$ is tangent to $(CD)$, thus, $\angle BCF = \angle FDC$. Therefore,
\[\boxed{\angle FEB} = 180^\circ - \angle FDC = 180^\circ - \boxed{\angle FCB}\]
