Let $f(x) = 3x^2+1$. Prove that for any given positive integer $n$, the
product
\[f(1) \cdot f(2) \cdots f(n)\]
has at most $n$ distinct prime divisors.

We would like to prove $f(n)$ introduces atmost 1 prime. Assume FTSOC
it does two, let $p,q$ be them with $p,q | f(n)$ then $p|f(n-p)$ $p | f(p-n)$ and similarly for $q$. 
Thus $n - p < 0 \implies p > n$ so, $p -n > n$. Similarly, $q > 2n$. 
But $3n^2 +1 = \alpha p \cdot q > 4\alpha n^2$, a contradiction.
